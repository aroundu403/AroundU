Over the last ten weeks, we have successfully developed AroundU, a map-based event finder. We started with a bold vision that we aren’t just building a functional course project but a fully polished product that has a great user experience. We knew this is a daunting task and we didn't have much experience with the tech stack we are using. We didn't know how to build the map interface for displaying the event and how to build a java backend when we first start. After the hard work we pulled into research and development, we demonstrated our ability to dance with uncertainty and carry out elegant solutions to implement our product vision.

This couldn't be done without the contribution of each team member who tried their best to contribute their talent. Many thanks to George for consolidating the project vision into concrete feature descriptions and requirements.  Can't express more gratitude to Wenxin and Wei for consistently delivering backend API. They have spent countless hours solving the backend challenges and leave the team with no surprise blocker. Appreciated Melody and Vandy developing the frontend pages by learning about the overwhelming amount of frontend knowledge in a short time. Super grateful for John to be the last resort for any problem and for helping team members to unlock challenging tasks. This project is a joint effort of tackling real-world software engineering challenges and developing a delicate product by maintaining high bars on product design, visual design, front-end development, backend development, and DevOps.

We will leave the debrief with the last notes on minor issues. Currently, AroundU only released the web version of the application. We planned to release the iOS version on App Store but Apple has a strict review process. We can't get the app approved and launched on App Store within the tight development Cycle. John will keep working on the iOS deployment after his graduation trip. We also have serval user experience issues that don't affect the functionality of the application but we didn't have enough time to address the low priority issues. Those issues can be solved later if AroundU attracts organic users. We can further develop this project if it can really benefit students.
