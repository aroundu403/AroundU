## Developer's Instructions

### Getting Started

- Install Maven and Java 11.
- (for local development only) 
    - Set up [Cloud SQL Auth proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-instance-auth-proxy)
    - [Connecting to Cloud SQL database](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-docs-samples/blob/main/cloud-sql/mysql/servlet/README.md)
  
- Put the environment variables into your bash file. The backend will need those secrets to access external
  dependencies. Contact John (wangj616@uw.edu) to get the secrets.
  - For Windows, put the environment variables in the "Environment Variables" setting.
- Make sure you have access to our Google Cloud Project and have your Google Credential on your local machine by one of the following method:
    1. Credentials file pointed to by the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable
    2. Credentials provided by the Google Cloud SDK.
        - `gcloud auth application-default login` for user account credentials.
        - `gcloud auth application-default login --impersonate-service-account` for impersonated service account credentials.
    3. Google App Engine built-in credentials
    4. Google Cloud Shell built-in credentials
    5. Google Compute Engine built-in credentials 
- Run maven command listed below to compile
    - There is no additional step, once the build is successfully, you should be able to spin up the
      SparkServer

### How to spin up the SparkServer

1. Add environment variable such as database password, which should be set up in previous step. Again, contact @John if
   you don't know them
2. run SparkServer (preferably using Intellij 'Run SparkServer.main()' feature)
    1. Once the server is running, Postman is used to test relevant data access and transfer

### How to use Maven
Run the following commands in `/backend`

1. `mvn install`
   Installs the packaged code to the local Maven repository.

2. `mvn complie`
   Compiles the source code, converts the .java files to .class and stores the classes in target/classes folder.

3. `mvn verify -Psurefire`
   Run integration tests under integration-test/java (testing the connection with database requires environment
   variables)

4. `mvn validate`
   Validates if the project structure is correct, checking if all the dependencies have been downloaded and are
   available in the local repository.
5. `mvn package`
   Packages the compiled code in distributable format like JAR.
6. `mvn clean`
   Clean the files and directories generated by Maven during its build

**Our project is configured that it will not run the integration tests during the build process. Running the tests would require to use the command listed above explicitly.**

### How to deploy to GCP cloud engine

Deploy backend code by manually triggering the deployment GitHub Actions. We have automated
the [build](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-java-with-maven) and
[deploy](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/about-deployments/deploying-with-github-actions) process by
reducing variations and setting up environment variables. Check
out [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/aroundu403/AroundU/actions) and files inside `.github/workflows` from top-level
directory for details.

**Remember to set up the environment variables
in [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-repository-and-organization-for-codespaces#adding-secrets-for-a-repository)**

### Test APIs using Postman

- Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com)
- make sure you started the SparkServer
- test the APIs as some examples are provided below

#### Examples

Using Postman `GET` with the example request url to get event data with `event_id = 1`

```
http://localhost:8080/event/id?eventid=1
```

Expected result:

```
{
    "code": 200,
    "message": "Success",
    "data": {
        "event_id": 1,
        "event_code": "EVENT1",
        "event_name": "New Student Fair",
        "description": "This is event1.",
        "host_id": "aaa111",
        "isPublic": 1,
        "isDeleted": 0,
        "location_name": "CSE1",
        "latitude": 47.65346,
        "longitude": -122.30597,
        "max_participants": 10,
        "curr_num_participants": 0,
        "photoID": "event1.jpg",
        "icon": "icon1.jpg",
        "address": "185 E Stevens Way NE, Seattle, WA 98195",
        "start_time": "2022-04-01 12:00:00.0",
        "end_time": "2022-04-02 12:00:00.0",
        "created_at": "2022-04-01 12:00:00.0"
    }
}
```

***
Using Postman `POST` with the example request url, and example request body to create a event

**You need to have a valid user token in the request header to test this. Contact @John if you need a user token**

Example request url:

```
http://localhost:8080/event
```

Example request body:

```
{
    "event_code": "EVENT3",
    "event_name": "event3",
    "description": "This is event3.",
    "host_id": "aaa111",
    "is_public":1,
    "is_deleted": 0,
    "location_name": "CSE2",
    "latitude":47.653157358950686, 
    "longitude":-122.30507501538806,
    "start_time": "2022-06-01 12:00:00", 
    "end_time": "2022-06-02 12:00:00",
    "max_participants": 20, 
    "curr_num_participants": 10, 
    "photo_id": "event3.jpg",
    "icon": "icon3.jpg",
    "address": "University of Washington, 3800 E Stevens Way NE, Seattle, WA 98195",
    "created_at": "Apr 1, 2022, 12:00:00 PM"
}
```

Expected result:

```
{
    "code": 200,
    "message": "Success",
    "data": 4           // this can be different
}
```

***
Use `Get` to retrieve data in the new two weeks:

```
http://localhost:8080/event/list
```

Sample result:

```
{
    "code": 200,
    "message": "Success",
    "data": [
        {
            "event_id": 3,

            "event_code": "EVENT2",
            "event_name": "HFS Feast",
            "description": "This is event2.",
            "host_id": "bbb222",

            "photo_id": "event2.jpg",
            "icon": "icon2.jpg",
            "address": "1201 NE Campus Pkwy, Seattle, WA 98105",
            "start_time": "2022-05-25 12:00:00.0",
            "end_time": "2022-05-28 12:00:00.0",
            "created_at": "2022-05-01 12:00:00.0"
        }
    ]
}

```

### Adding new tests

Although we mainly used Postman for testing, we still have integration-test under `src/integration-test/java` to
test out the basic APIs. If more tests are need, they should be added to ApiIT.java`. You can find sample testing in there.

If you want to use Postman to test, detailed instructions are listed above.
